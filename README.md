# Hello, DynamoDB (Document Model)!

This is the code project for the [Hello, DynamoDB! (Document Model)](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-dynamodb-document-model) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon DynamoDB and the document model. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll explain NoSQL databases, introduce DynamoDB, and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to store and retrieve JSON documents. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6

## Our Hello, DynamoDB Project

We will use DynamoDB to store and retrieve recipes in the form of JSON documents. We will first create a DynamoDB table in the AWS console. Then, we'll write a .NET program that can put, list, and get documents using the AWS SDK for .NET Document API for DynamoDB

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.

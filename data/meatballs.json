  "intro": "I have recently made a few new recipes.  Two of them by Bobby Flay – and both of them outstanding! This one is for Spaghetti and Sauce.  We LOVED the meatballs!  I will be making them again in the future – maybe even in bulk to freeze them for the future.  I did  not use veal as it is sometimes hard to find.  I doubled the recipe because we had more than 4 people eating dinner… Now I wish I had made even more!",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 lbs ground beef",
    "1 lb ground pork",
    "4 large eggs",
    "1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese",
    "8 cloves garlic, finely minced and sauteed",
    "1/2 cup dry bread crumbs",
    "1/2 cup finely chopped parsley",
    "2 tsp salt",
    "1/2 tsp pepper",
    "1 cup olive oil/canola oil"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a large bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, eggs, grated Parmesan, cooked garlic, dry bread crumbs, minced fresh parsley, salt, and pepper.  Use two large serving forks to break up the meat and mix all the ingredients until it is evenly seasoned.  Do not overwork it as it will become tough.  Form 1 to 1 1/2 inch meatballs with your hands.",
    "Heat a non stick skillet with 1 cup of cooking oil over medium high heat.  Cook the meatballs in batches, turning them over with tongs and continue cooking until golden brown. You do not need to cook them through entirely, as you simmer them in the sauce.  Drain the meatballs on a wire rack for a few minutes while you finish cooking the remaining meatballs."
